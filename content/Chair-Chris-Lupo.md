In 2017, Chris Lupo was selected as the new Department Chair.

Wow! Bang! Four big years have passed.

In 2020, Chris Lupo agreed to be Department Chair again, and immediately the world was plunged into chaos. Keep in mind that correlation is not the same as causation.

As I write this, it's now May 2021, and Cal Poly appears at this point and from this lowly perspective to have weathered the Covid-19 storm much better than expected. Enrollments are VERY strong for next year, and we're hiring like crazy. 

What will the next four years bring? Who knows!
