2006-2016 Department Chair: Ignatios Vakalis
============================================

In 2006, we conducted a search for an external department head. We saw
quite a number of candidates, but one of them was head and shoulders
(and torso) above all of the rest, Ignatios Vakalis. We made the obvious
and correct decision, and every year since then has confirmed our
confidence and admiration for him.

#### 2014-15

This was a good year for us. Last year's hires (Shinjiro Sueda and
Davide Falessi) both are fantastic, and we also made two new hires
(Lubomir Stanchev and Bruce DeBruhl). The Data Science minor / joint
program with Statistics is coming along and looks very promising. Chris
Lupo was on Sabbatical.

## California Budget Crunch

* furloughs!
* "mega-" classes

## New Dean(s), Provost, President.

### New Deans

We've had two new deans since 2006, I believe; when Peter Lee left, we
got Mohammad Noori. Noori left in 2010, and Erling Smith served as interim
dean for a year while we conducted another search. We hired Deb Larson
the next year, and she's been here since then.

### New Provosts

Bill Durgin was with us for a while, and then he wasn't. Erstwhile Cal
Poly administrator Robert Koob Served for ... a year? ... and was, I believe,
widely admired in much the same way that Gerry Brown is--he was honest,
not overly concerned with his upward career trajectory, and tried to do
the best for the university.

When he stepped down, Kathleen Enz Finken was hired, and she's been here
ever since.

### New President

Warren Baker, Cal Poly president for many many years (30? 40?) stepped
down about three years ago, and we hired Jeffrey Armstrong.
