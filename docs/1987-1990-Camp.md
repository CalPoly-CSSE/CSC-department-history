1987-1990 Department Chair-Roger Camp
=====================================

Introduction
------------

Dr. Roger C. Camp was appointed chairman of the Computer Science
Department for a three year term, effective Summer Quarter, 1987.

The appointment made by Dean of Engineering, Peter Y. Lee, was based
upon the recommendation of the department faculty with the concurrence
of President Warren Baker. Roger joined the Cal Poly faculty in 1984. He
taught for 26 years at Iowa State University after earning his B.S. and
Ph.D. in electrical engineering.

His industrial experience includes a year in systems marketing with
Motorola and numerous consulting assignments that resulted in the design
and development of a number of computer-based devices. Roger has written
four textbooks.

Camp succeeds Dr. Daniel F. Stubbs who took over from Neil Webre and had
led the department as an interim chair for a year.

[

Editor’s Note: Roger once remarked to me that his legacy as the Csc
Chairman will be the one who put windows in the classroom doors in
building 14. If you thought they were always there, it means you came
after Camp’s tenure. If you came before, you know the importance of
those windows while walking in the narrow hallway of Building 14.]

Computer Developments
---------------------

What did the next three years of computer evolution bring?

1.  In 1987, Motorola unveiled the 68030 microprocessor. A step up from
    the 68020, it built on a 32-bit enhanced microprocessor with a
    central processing unit core, a data cache, an instruction cache, an
    enhanced bus controller, and a memory management unit in a single
    VLSI device – all operating at speeds of at least 20 MHz.

2.  Apple engineer William Atkinson designed HyperCard, a software tool
    that simplifies development of in-house applications. HyperCard
    differed from previous programs of its sort because Atkinson made it
    interactive rather than language-based and geared it toward the
    construction of user interfaces rather than the processing of data.
    In HyperCard, programmers built stacks with the concept of hypertext
    links between stacks of pages. Apple distributed the program free
    with Macintosh computers until 1992.

3.  IBM released a new operating system, OS/2, at the same time,
    allowing the use of a mouse with the PC.

4.  In 1988, Apple cofounder Steve Jobs, who left Apple to form his own
    company, unveiled the NeXT. The computer he created failed but was
    recognized as an important innovation. At a base price of $6,500,
    the NeXT ran too slowly to be popular.

5.  Intel released the 80486 microprocessor and the i860
    RISC/coprocessor chip, each of which contained more than 1 million
    transistors. The RISC microprocessor had a 32-bit integer arithmetic
    and logic unit (the part of the CPU that performs operations such as
    addition and subtraction), a 64-bit, floating-point unit, and a
    clock rate of 33 MHz.

Unix Gets a GUI
---------------

The X Window System (known as just X), first appeared in the mid 1980’s
running on DEC VAX based Unix workstations. X was developed at MIT (with
support from Digital) as part of MIT’s Project Athena distributed
workstation environment. Many of the core ideas of X (as well as the X
name) were derived from an earlier Stanford windowing system named W.
Other ideas came from Sun’s SunView environment which ran on the 68000
based Sun-3 workstations. The early versions of X were developed
primarily by Robert Scheifler, Ron Newman and Jim Gettys. X went on to
become the basic graphics system of all the RISC based Unix
workstations.

Aside from providing Unix with a graphical user interface, X’s main
contribution to the computing world was the idea of displaying an
application remotely over a network (ie: running an application on one
machine but displaying its user interface on another, much like telnet
already provided for command line Unix users). The implementation was a
client-server approach, where an X window system server ran on the
displaying machine, and the client programs communicated with it using a
network protocol. The X server and its client programs could be running
on the same machine, or on different machines, it didn’t matter.

X had an unusual career. In somewhat of an odd decision, its designers
decided that X should only provide mechanism, not policy. So X did not
provide any particular look and feel, but instead only provided the
basic mechanisms on top of which several different user interface styles
were later implemented.

State of the Computer Science Department
----------------------------------------

As Roger started as Chairman, the Csc Department had 470 full time
equivalent undergraduate majors, 60 graduate majors, and 350 full time
equivalent computer literacy students. (service courses taught by Csc
faculty) There were 28.2 full time equivalent faculty which translates
to 38 people as some assignments are part time. The salaries of faculty
and staff exceeded $1 million with an annual equipment budget of
$40,000. The Computer Systems Laboratory had an inventory of $2.8
million, consisting of Pyramid 98XE, Tandem 6AX microcomputers, Sequent
Balance, Sun Workstations, Xerox Workstations, AT&T Workstations, HP
64000 emulations systems, and many servers and printers.

Literacy and Tandem Laboratory
------------------------------

Don Fowler of Tandem Computers and Roger Camp of Cal Poly made a
commitment to improve the literacy laboratories at Cal Poly. To assist
in this goal, Tandem presented Cal Poly with equipment for two new
laboratories each containing 20 networked IBM PC-AT compatibles. This
gift was made specifically to enhance the university service courses.
The 40 workstations, each with two floppy disk drives and a hard drive
were networked with two Unix-based file servers, located in the CSL, and
print servers with laser printers. Network software, application
packages and the hardware brought the cost of the Tandem donation to
over $440,000.00.

Chirica wins TRW Award
----------------------

TRW Inc. awarded $4,000.00 to a Cal Poly computer science professor as
the first of what is to be an annual Excellence in Teaching Award to a
member of the University’s School of Engineering faculty. Dr. Laurian M.
Chirica received a check, plaque and a certificate from TRW officials at
a school faculty meeting. Also attending were Cal Poly President Warren
J. Baker and Interim Dean of Engineering, Peter Y. Lee.

Chirica joined the faculty in 1984 and has taught a variety of courses,
from an introduction to computer science to graduate courses in database
management. He has several specializations and interests within the
areas of database-management systems, programming languages, systems
programming and computer science theory.

Cal Poly Students and Apple Project
-----------------------------------

The following project by two Cal Poly Csc students, Darren Giles and
Michael Morgan, was used by Apple CEO, John Sculley as reported in
MacWeek, 29 Nov, 1988.

> Nashville, Tenn. – CEO John Sculley and 21-year programming whiz
> Darren Giles teamed up here this week to demonstrate the latest step
> on the road to Knowledge Navigator: a HyperCard front end to a
> sophisticated executive information database that brings powerful
> information gathering abilities to college administrators who have
> minimal computing experience.
>
> As part of his keynote address to CAUSE, a national education
> computing organization, Sculley showed new Mac software designed to
> retrieve information from the Executive Support System, a mainframe
> MIS database published by Information Associates of Rochester, N.Y.
>
> The new Macintosh software uses a HyperCard point-and-click interface
> to allow managers to extract university management data and do
> sophisticated charting on institutional mainframes. The new Macintosh
> front end was developed as a joint effort by Information Associates,
> Apple and a student programming team at California Polytechnic
> University, San Luis Obispo. Giles, a senior computer science student,
> led the Cal Poly group. According to Giles, Apple decided to showcase
> the program because it fits in with Sculley’s year-long plan to
> highlight what he calls \`"enabling technologies,\`" innovations that
> give information to people who wouldn’t otherwise have gotten it.
>
> \`"You could say this new front end is a step along the road to
> Knowledge Navigator,\`" Giles said, referring to Apple’s year-old
> video which showed a future computer that melds hypermedia, large
> databases, global communications and simulations.
>
> According to Giles, Executive Support System software has been a
> popular mainframe MIS system for several years, but the existing
> MS-DOS retrieval interface forced managers who needed the data to
> depend on researcher/programmers to access it.
>
> In a five-month crash program, Cal Poly students, Giles, graduate
> student Michael Morgan, and Cal Poly faculty supervisor, Elmo Keller
> took the concepts behind the user-hostile MS-DOS command-line
> interface and transformed them into something significantly easier,
> \`"with new features, practically a new program.\`" The Mac version,
> Giles said, can be used by computer inexperienced administrators and
> other managers with just half an hour of training.
>
> Ironically, development was slowed somewhat because of the quick
> success Giles and Morgan had in prototyping the program. Apple kept
> interrupting development to fly the developers to conferences to
> demonstrate its potential. Last month Giles demonstrated the program
> at EDUCOM, another educational consortium, and he will be on hand Dec.
> 1 to help Sculley during the keynote address.
>
> \`"It’s exciting when you write a program that makes a difference
> about what people can do, a normal person, not just someone who’s
> studied computers for 12 years,\`" Giles said.
>
> Giles has been programming longer than Sculley has been associated
> with computers. With instruction from his father, a math and computer
> programming professor at California’s Santa Rosa Junior College, he
> wrote his first program at the age of 12. \`"Starting early has real
> advantages,\`" he said. \`"I pretty much think in code. People who
> pick it up later aren’t quite as fluent.\`"
>
> The main programmer on the project, Giles created a HyperCard user
> interface, which was altered often as new users tested the system. He
> and Morgan added external commands written in Pascal and custom macros
> built with Affinity Microsystems’ Tempo II that allow the front end to
> automatically chart data in Microsoft Excel and Cricket Graph.
>
> DOS users wanting to extract data from the Executive Support System
> have to type in as many as 20 screens of arcane commands in a variety
> of complex programs, including dBASE III Plus, Lotus 1-2-3 and Harvard
> Graphics, according to Walter Mark, director of institutional studies
> at Cal Poly. \`"If there was an error, all the time was wasted. I
> could see the university president doing that once and getting nothing
> and never using the system again. Anybody who sees the Mac version
> compared to the IBM wants it,\`" he added, noting that several
> departments at the San Luis Obispo campus have recently adopted the
> Mac.
>
> After Sculley’s demonstration, the Giles-Morgan program will be taken
> in house at Information Associates for quality control testing, then
> it will be made available to colleges and universities. An early
> prospect is the 19-campus California State University system, of which
> Cal Poly is a branch. Pricing for the program has not yet been
> established. It will run on any Mac Plus, SE or II with at least 2
> Mbytes of memory.

Bob Dourson, who had 25 years in the computer industry before coming to
the Csc Department, retired in the Spring of 1987 after 20 years at Cal
Poly. Bob, who never met a programming problem he could not debug, was
the official department “programming-problem solver.” He had an amazing
talent to find problems in complex programs and would analyze anyone’s
code – student, faculty, or computer center staff.
