As I write this, in September 2023, Aaron Keen has been chosen as
the new department chair for the department of Computer Science
and Software Engineering. It appears that the next three years
will be eventful ones, and I think many of us are confident
that Dr. Keen will do an amazing job at piloting this increasingly
large ship.
