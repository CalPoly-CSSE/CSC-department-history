In 2017, Chris Lupo was selected as the new Department Chair.

Wow! Bang! Four big years have passed.

In 2020, Chris Lupo agreed to be Department Chair again, and immediately the world was plunged into chaos. Keep in mind that correlation is not the same as causation.

As I write this, it's now May 2021, and Cal Poly appears at this point and from this lowly perspective to have weathered the Covid-19 storm much better than expected. Enrollments are VERY strong for next year, and we're hiring like crazy. 

What will the next four years bring? Who knows!

Well, okay, another two years have passed. The department has grown significantly, adding
many new faculty. Another important change is that Computer Engineering has
taken its place as a full-fledged department, no longer a program split
between CSSE and EE. This is good news for CPE and good news for its students,
long live CPE!

Another change is the formation of the Noyce school, with funding generously
contributed from the remainder of the Noyce trust. The first director of
the Noyce school has been chosen, and it's ... Chris Lupo! So Chris is no
longer our department chair, but we're in good hands with the selection of
our new department chair, Aaron Keen.
