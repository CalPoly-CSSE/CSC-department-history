Welcome to the CSC-department-history wiki!

## Mission Statement

The Computer Science Department educates students in the discipline
of computer science and teaches them to apply their education to solve
practical problems in a socially responsible way. Pursuant to the
department's educational mission, faculty engage in research and professional
development that allows them to remain current in their fields and
to provide technological leadership to the university community.

## Foreword

The history of the Cal Poly Computer Science Department starts with
large mainframes and card input, goes to timesharing and Unix, to 
small personal computers,
and thence to mobile devices more powerful than
the original mainframes. It moves from isolated machines, to 300 baud
modem connection, to 56K telephone communication, to megabit networks,
and on toward gigabit wireless communication networks; from telnet and anonymous
ftp, to Archie, to point and click browsers, to hypertext languages
and the World Wide Web. 

Programming starts out with a small "formula-like language,"
called Fortran, moves to PL/I, to Pascal, to Modula-2, to Ada, to
C/C++, to Java, and Racket; from no "goto"s, to modular programming, to
object oriented programming, to distributed programming. Yeah, okay, I edited 
that paragraph.

What an exciting time period to be in this field. Rarely has any discipline
had such dramatic changes. What a challenge for a faculty to "teach
students in the discipline of computer science."

Like mathematicians, we use formal languages to denote ideas.
 Like engineers, we design and create programs, assembling
components into systems and evaluating trade-offs among alternatives.
Like scientists, we analyze and study the behavior of complex systems.
The technology development underlying our profession has only one
direction - forward, and only one speed -- wide open. 

What will computer science be in the future? How do we visualize it?
Based on the last 30 years, it will be impossible to predict -- enjoy
the journey!

This volume relates the story of the evolution of the Cal Poly Computer
Science Department over the past quarter century. 

As you read, identify the people in the pictures and in your mind's
eye go back in time with them and put yourself in their places. Try
to understand their opportunities, their challenges. We hope you enjoy
reading this small history and gain an even greater appreciation of
your students, the faculty who preceded you, and our profession.
